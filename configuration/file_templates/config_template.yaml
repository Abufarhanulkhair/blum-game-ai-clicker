# GENERAL SETTINGS
HOST_SETTINGS:
  # Specify your screen resolution to ensure precise coordinate conversion from the Telegram window to your screen.
  # Example for a 2k monitor: 2560x1440, for an HD monitor: 1920x1080
  # Enter only numbers in the format WIDTHxHEIGHT, without adding pixels or any other symbols.
  HOST_SCREEN_RESOLUTION:
    WIDTH: 2560px
    HEIGHT: 1440px

# IN-GAME SETTINGS
BLUM_SETTINGS:
  # Specify the name of the application window where you will run Telegram with the Blum bot.
  # This should be the exact name as it appears in your system's window manager.
  # For example, if the window title is "Telegram - Blum Bot", use that exact string.
  # This ensures the AI clicker targets the correct window for object detection (stars, bombs, freeze).
  TELEGRAM_WINDOW_NAME: "Blum"

  NON_CLICKABLE_AREA:
    PADDING_LEFT: 200px
    PADDING_RIGHT: 200px
    PADDING_TOP: 50px
    PADDING_BOTTOM: 50px

  # The clicker includes a system to avoid clicking on a bomb if it is too close to a star.
  # Due to the delay between object appearance and detection, a bomb might occasionally be clicked by mistake.
  # To mitigate this, a coefficient is used to extend the safe distance between bombs and stars.
  # The value represents the multiplier for the distance, measured in star widths.
  # For example, a value of 1.5 means a star will not be clicked if a bomb is closer than 1.5 star widths.
  # Recommended value: 1.5-2. Adjust according to your system's performance and in-game results.
  STARS_FROM_BOMB: 1.5
